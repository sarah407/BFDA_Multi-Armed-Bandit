# Enhancing Experimental Design through Bayes Factor Design Analysis: Insights from an Example Estimating Random Exploration within a Multi-Armed Bandit Task

## Introduction
This is the code used for the simulations and analysis in the paper 'Enhancing Experimental Design through Bayes Factor Design Analysis: Insights from an Example Estimating Random Exploration within a Multi-Armed Bandit Task' (submitted, currently in review). 
The pipeline simulates behavioural data from a two-armed bandit task, after which estimates of the exploration parameter and differences in exploration between groups are analysed.
A design analysis using Bayes Factor was conducted to examine the correlation between sample size and the strength of evidence for a difference in exploration between two groups. This analysis considers the likelihood of substantial evidence for an incorrect hypothesis and the likelihood of insufficient evidence for the correct hypothesis.

## Analysis
The data resulting form the simulations and analysis is stored in the 'data' folder and includes the files:
- data_within_group.pckl
    - data from estimating the exploration parameter within one group
    - includes the variables estimations, means, var 
        - estimations: array
